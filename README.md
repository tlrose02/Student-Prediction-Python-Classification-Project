# Student_Prediction
This project was an attempt to use Logistic Regression in order to predict the likelihood of a student failing their upcoming courses. I received the dataset from a colleague as a means of practicing classification problems. The Jupyter Notebook along with the Excel files attached will allow you to follow along easily if you want to replicate this yourself.
